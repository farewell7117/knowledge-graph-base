# Knowledge Graph Base (KGB)

### Introduction

Knowledge Graphs allow ubiquitous representations of data, in particular, we will work with scholarly citation networks. The goal of the project is to represent a set of scientific papers and references among them in 2D layout, providing that semantically similar objects will be located close to each other.

### Problem statement

The complexity of the data generated from non-Euclidean domains has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this project we provide a comparative research on modern techniques of graph data analysis and estimate the application of GCN to standard knowledge base completion task: recovery of missing facts, i.e. subject-predicate-object triples.

### Objectives

1. Find appropriate methodology for evaluation of embedding quality;
2. Study state-of-the-art techniques for Graph Embedding problem, e.g. GNN and implement them and evaluate their quality<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>;
3. Implement a python module that gets a set of papers (parsed jsons with metadata and references) and visualizes embedding.
